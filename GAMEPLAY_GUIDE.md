# Ashen Harbor Hotel - Gameplay Tips & Strategy Guide

## For Players: How to Win

### Objective Recap
1. Collect all 4 clues scattered around the hotel
2. Keep your fear from reaching 100%
3. Avoid the ghost patrolling the halls
4. Reach the service elevator once all clues are found

### Strategy Tips

#### Early Game (0-2 min)
- **Move toward the lights** - Stay in lit areas to reduce fear naturally
- **Listen for ambient sounds** - The audio design will tell you when threats are near
- **Explore methodically** - Don't rush; the ghost patrols on a schedule
- **Collect clues safely** - Most are in well-lit or accessible areas first

#### Mid Game (2-5 min)
- **Map the patrol routes** - Watch where the ghost goes when you spot it
- **Use the lights strategically** - Plan routes between lamp locations
- **Don't panic-run** - Running consumes stamina and increases visible fear
- **Steady breathing proactively** - Use E when fear is 70%+, not at 95%+

#### Late Game (5+ min)
- **Path to the exit** - Once all clues found, know the safest route
- **Ghost gets faster** - Your fear increases its speed, so stay calm
- **Final dash** - If ghost is far away, sprint to the exit
- **Use audio cues** - Heartbeat rhythm increases as danger approaches

### Clue Locations & Tips

| Clue | Location | Tip | Difficulty |
|------|----------|-----|------------|
| **Room 305 Ledger** | Northwest corner (3.5, 1.5) | Very well-lit area; collect first | Easy |
| **Maintenance Recorder** | Central-east area (12.5, 7.5) | Mid-map; relatively safe | Medium |
| **Bloodied Keycard** | Southwest middle (4.5, 11.5) | Adjacent to ghost patrol route | Medium |
| **Polaroid In Static** | Far southeast (14.5, 15.5) | Start position area; safest last | Easy |

**Recommended collection order**: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 (easiest to hardest)

### Fear Management

**Natural decay**:
- Near lights: Lose ~0.24% fear per second
- In darkness: Gain ~0.09% fear per second

**Active reduction**:
- Press E (steady breath): Lose 25% fear instantly (3.5 sec cooldown)

**Danger factors**:
- Ghost approaching: Fear spikes by up to 0.5 per second
- Extreme fear: Ghost moves 80% faster at max fear

**Pro tip**: Keep breathing steady. Use E before reaching 80% fear to avoid panic spiral.

### Audio Cues to Know

| Sound | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Low ambient drone | Background atmosphere | Normal; stay alert |
| Pulsing heartbeat | Ghost nearby | Slow movement; don't run |
| Fast heartbeat | Ghost very close | Find a light or hide |
| Whisper/voice | Detection confirmed | Ghost is chasing; RUN |
| Ding (bell tone) | All clues found | Head to exit immediately |
| Ascending chime | Clue collected | Continue exploration |

### Movement Tactics

**Stealth approach**:
- Walk slowly (no sprint) to avoid alerting ghost
- Move along walls to use line-of-sight blockers
- Pause in bright areas and listen for danger

**Speed approach** (risky):
- Sprint between light sources
- Shortest path to clues
- Only viable if ghost is far away
- High-fear, high-reward

**Balanced approach** (recommended):
- Normal walk pace most of time
- Sprint only when necessary
- Stay within 1-2 rooms of a light
- Collect clues, then power-dash to exit

### Win Conditions

**Victory**: Reach the service elevator after collecting all 4 clues
- Elevator door appears with green tint
- Audio plays ascending chord
- Case closes; you escape

**Defeat**: Ghost catches you (instant fail)
- Audible failure sound
- Red flash overlay
- Game offers to reopen the case

**Panic failure**: Fear reaches 100%
- Screen flashes red
- Narration: "The panic roars loud enough to drown the waves"
- Same result as ghost catch

## Difficulty Modifiers (Play Style)

### Nightmare Mode (Self-Imposed)
- Try speedrun (< 3 min to exit)
- No E key usage (cold turkey on steadying breath)
- Collect clues in reverse order (hardest first)
- Deliberately trigger ghost chase

### Relaxed Mode
- Ignore fear meter; explore at leisure
- Focus on atmosphere and story
- No time limits
- Great for first-time players

### Perfect Run Challenge
- Collect all 4 clues while fear stays < 30%
- Means maximum light-hugging
- Very strategic movement required
- Rewards patience over speed

## Story & Atmosphere

The game's tone is psychological horror—not jump-scares. Pay attention to:

- **Narration text**: Detective thoughts revealing the mystery
- **Idle whispers**: Atmospheric details about the hotel
- **Ghost behavior**: It's intelligent and hunting; not random
- **Audio evolution**: As fear increases, sounds become more distorted

The Ashen Harbor Hotel isn't just a building—it's a character. Explore, listen, and piece together what happened to the previous investigators.

## Replay Value

**After beating once**:
- Try different collection orders
- Challenge speedrun times
- Play without using E key
- Seek alternate paths through the hotel
- Find different narration combinations
- Create your own difficulty rules

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happens if I look at the ghost directly?**
A: It speeds up and begins chasing. Eye contact = threat.

**Q: Can I kill the ghost?**
A: No. This is an investigation, not a combat game. Your only defense is awareness and speed.

**Q: Do clues have story endings?**
A: Yes! Read each clue's detail in the narration. Together they form a mystery.

**Q: Is there a "safe room" I can hide in?**
A: No, but lights prevent the ghost from getting close (high fear increases its speed).

**Q: What's with the "Amber elevator" mentioned in the recorder?**
A: Pay attention to clue details. The hotel has a history of odd incidents.

**Q: How fast can I beat the game?**
A: Expert players: ~2-3 minutes. Casual: 5-10 minutes.

**Q: Can I play this on mobile?**
A: Not currently. Pointer lock (mouse capture) requires a desktop browser.

**Q: Is there a multiplayer mode?**
A: Not yet, but it's a cool idea! One player could guide another.
